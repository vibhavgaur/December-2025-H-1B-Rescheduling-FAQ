# H-1B OFC / Consular Rescheduling FAQ (India)

This FAQ is compiled from a group chat of applicants whose OFC/Consular appointments were cancelled and auto-rescheduled to later dates.  
It reflects **only what people reported in the chat**, not official guidance.

> **Scope:** H-1B (and similar) visa stamping in India; bulk cancellations/reschedules (not individual case denials).

# Disclaimer

- This FAQ is informational and community-sourced. It is not legal advice and may be incomplete or outdated.
- ChatGPT was used to process the WhatsApp group's chat history and generate this FAQ (so take it with a grain of salt, and double-check important details as you deem necessary)

---

## Quick takeaways

- Bulk cancellations clustered around **mid–late December** dates.
- Many people were **auto-rescheduled to months later** (some into 2026).
- The ability to **reschedule in the portal** often appears **24–48 hours after OFC**.
- If you have a **currently valid H-1B stamp**, doing OFC **does not** invalidate it; many believed you can still return using it.

# FAQ

## 1) Why were appointments cancelled/rescheduled?

**Q:** Why are appointments being cancelled en masse? Is there a reason?  
**A (from chat):**
- People believed it was a **mass administrative action** (not applicant-specific).
- Theories mentioned: **holiday capacity reduction**, **backlog**, or **new vetting (social media)** — but **no confirmed official explanation** surfaced in the chat.
- Multiple people said their social media was public and still got cancelled → **social media privacy likely not the cause**.

---

## 2) Which dates were most affected?

**Q:** Are cancellations limited to certain dates?  
**A (from chat):**
- Strong clustering around **Dec 15–Dec 23**.
- Group polls suggested most cancellations fell in **Dec 15–20**, some in **Dec 21–25**, and fewer beyond that (at the time people were discussing).

---

## 3) Which locations were impacted?

**Q:** Is it only Chennai? What about Hyderabad/Delhi?  
**A (from chat):**
- **Chennai**: heavily impacted.
- **Hyderabad**: cancellations reported as well.
- **Delhi**: people asked, but the chat did not establish clear data points at the time.

---

## 4) Is there a pattern to the new dates assigned?

**Q:** Is there a pattern to rescheduled dates?  
**A (from chat):**
- No strict pattern; people observed a rough “later date” mapping by original appointment date (mid-Dec → Mar/Apr/May/Jun).
- Many believed the system simply assigns the **earliest available slot** automatically (not a priority slot).

---

## 5) Does this happen to everyone in those date ranges?

**Q:** Is this happening to everyone or only some people?  
**A (from chat):**
- Not everyone, but a large majority in affected ranges.
- A few people retained December interviews; others were cancelled.
- People described it as **random within affected windows**.

---

## 6) Should I still attend my OFC (biometrics) if my consular is cancelled or might be cancelled?

**Q:** My OFC is still scheduled—should I go?  
**A (from chat):**
- Many people planned to **attend OFC if it was still active**.
- OFC completion was seen as useful because it may unlock rescheduling options later.

---

## 7) After OFC, can I reschedule only the consular appointment?

**Q:** If I complete OFC, can I reschedule just the interview?  
**A (from chat):**
- Many said **yes**.
- The reschedule option often appeared **24–48 hours after OFC**.
- At the time, most reported **no slots available**, even if reschedule was technically possible.

---

## 8) My portal says I have attempts left, but there is no reschedule button

**Q:** I see “attempt(s) left” but no reschedule UI—why?  
**A (from chat):**
- People reported the reschedule option sometimes appears **24–48 hours after biometrics**.
- Others said it appeared after some waiting without any action.

---

## 9) If I attend OFC but cancel/miss consular, is that a “no-show” or denial?

**Q:** Would attending one and cancelling the other count as a no-show / denial?  
**A (from chat):**
- No one provided a definitive official rule.
- People did **not** treat “cancel consular after OFC” as a visa denial.
- The chat was less clear about consequences of missing without cancelling.

---

## 10) Can I return to the US if I already have a valid H-1B stamp?

**Q:** If my consular is pushed out, can I travel back using my existing stamped visa?  
**A (from chat):**
- Many said **yes**, if your current visa stamp is still valid.
- People did not report OFC completion invalidating an existing valid stamp.

---

## 11) What if my stamp is expired / this is my first stamping?

**Q:** If my stamp is expired (or I’ve never had a stamp), what happens?  
**A (from chat):**
- Without a valid stamp, people believed you **cannot return** until you complete the consular interview and get stamped.
- Several referenced prior disruptions (e.g., floods) where people were stuck for months but eventually returned.

---

## 12) Should I travel to India if I haven’t flown yet?

**Q:** My interview is coming up but I’m still in the US—should I go?  
**A (from chat):**
- Strong consensus: **don’t travel unless urgent**.
- Some people said their employers/HR advised **not to travel**.

---

## 13) Are January appointments getting cancelled too?

**Q:** Any cancellations for January interviews?  
**A (from chat):**
- Not confirmed at the time.
- Some believed processing was still focused on December cancellations.

---

## 14) Is this related to social media profiles being public/private?

**Q:** Do I need to make social media public to avoid cancellation?  
**A (from chat):**
- Multiple people with public profiles still got cancelled.
- Consensus: **likely unrelated**.

---

## 15) Can I work from India while waiting?

**Q:** Can I work remotely from India while stuck waiting for a new interview date?  
**A (from chat):**
- Depends heavily on employer.
- People reported outcomes like:
  - Allowed remote work from India (some for extended periods)
  - Limits like “~30 days outside approved location”
  - Fall-back options: **PTO**, **leave of absence (LOA)**, **unpaid leave**

---

## 16) Will the consulate/helpline help or prioritize cancelled candidates?

**Q:** Will there be any help or prioritization?  
**A (from chat):**
- People who contacted the helpline said they were told to **follow the new date** or **try rescheduling**.
- No confirmed priority mechanism emerged in the chat.

---

## 17) Do I need to redo DS-160 / refile forms if I reschedule?

**Q:** If I reschedule again, do I need to refill everything?  
**A (from chat):**
- Unresolved in the chat.
- Most assumed no refile was needed unless the portal explicitly forced it.

---

## 18) Can I resubmit DS-160 with updated social media profiles if I didn't add them initially?

**Q:** I filled my DS-160 a long time ago and didn't include social media profiles. Can I create a new DS-160 with updated social media information?  
**A (from chat):**
- **Yes, you can create a new DS-160** with updated social media profiles.
- **Before OFC (biometrics):** You can fill out a new DS-160 and take both old and new DS-160 forms to the OFC appointment. Staff will update it in their system.
- **After OFC (before consular interview):** You can still create a new DS-160 and take it to the consular interview. Multiple people reported doing this successfully. People also took a single page with all their social media handles and links listed and submitted that at the consular interview as well.
